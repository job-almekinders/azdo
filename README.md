## Demo Mode

Want to try azdo without an Azure DevOps account? Run the demo — no configuration, no PAT, no setup required:

```bash
azdo demo
```

This launches the full TUI with realistic mock data (two fictional projects, pull requests with diffs, work items, pipeline runs with logs). All features work — you can navigate, view details, switch themes, and explore the UI. Perfect for evaluating the tool or taking screenshots.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Start the TUI
azdo

# Try it out with mock data (no setup needed)
azdo demo

# Set or update your Personal Access Token
azdo auth

# Show version
azdo --version

# Show help
azdo --help
```

## Configuration

### 1. Create Configuration File

When running azdo for the first time, a **wizard setup** will help you setup this.
Otherwise follow these instructions.

Create a configuration file at the following location:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/azdo-tui/config.yaml`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.config\azdo-tui\config.yaml`

```yaml
# Azure DevOps organization name (required)
organization: your-org-name

# Azure DevOps project name(s) (required)
# Simple format:
projects:
  - your-project-name

# With display names (friendly name shown in UI):
#   projects:
#     - name: ugly-api-project-name
#       display_name: My Project
#     - name: ugly-api-project-name-2
#       display_name: My Project 2

# Polling interval in seconds (optional, default: 60)
polling_interval: 60

# Theme (optional, default: dark)
# Available themes: dark, gruvbox, nord, dracula, catppuccin, github, retro, monokai
theme: dark

# Authentication method (optional, default: pat)
# Use 'az-cli' to authenticate via the Azure CLI instead of a PAT.
# auth_method: az-cli

# Disable specific panes (optional, comma-separated)
# Valid values: pipelines, workitems
# disabled_panes: pipelines,workitems
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `organization`: Your Azure DevOps organization name (required)
- `projects`: List of Azure DevOps project names (required). Each entry can be a plain string or an object with `name` and `display_name` fields. The `display_name` is shown in the TUI while the `name` is used for API calls.
- `polling_interval`: How often to refresh data in seconds (optional, default: 60)
- `theme`: Color theme for the UI (optional, default: dark)
- `disabled_panes`: Comma-separated list of panes to hide (optional). Valid values: `pipelines`, `workitems`. When a pane is disabled, its tab, keyboard shortcuts, and all related UI are removed. Pull Requests cannot be disabled.
- `auth_method`: Authentication method (optional, default: `pat`). Set to `az-cli` to use the Azure CLI instead of a PAT — see [Azure CLI Authentication](#azure-cli-authentication) below.

**Available Themes:**
- `dark` - Dark theme with blue and cyan accents
- `gruvbox` - Retro groove color scheme
- `nord` - Arctic, north-bluish color palette
- `dracula` - Default dark theme with purple and pink accents
- `catppuccin` - Soothing pastel theme (Mocha variant)
- `github` - GitHub Dark theme
- `retro` - Matrix-inspired green phosphor on black
- `monokai` - Classic Monokai color scheme

### Custom Themes

You can create your own custom themes by placing JSON theme files in the themes directory:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/azdo-tui/themes/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.config\azdo-tui\themes\`

**Creating a Custom Theme:**

1. Create the themes directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/azdo-tui/themes
   ```

2. Create a JSON theme file (e.g., `mytheme.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "mytheme",
     "primary": "#0088ff",
     "secondary": "#00aaff",
     "accent": "#ff8800",
     "success": "#00ff88",
     "warning": "#ffaa00",
     "error": "#ff4444",
     "info": "#00ccff",
     "background": "#1a1b26",
     "background_alt": "#24283b",
     "background_select": "#343b58",
     "foreground": "#c0caf5",
     "foreground_muted": "#787c99",
     "foreground_bold": "#ffffff",
     "select_foreground": "#ffffff",
     "select_background": "#0088ff",
     "border": "#3b4261",
     "link": "#7aa2f7",
     "spinner": "#bb9af7",
     "tab_active_foreground": "#ffffff",
     "tab_active_background": "#0088ff",
     "tab_inactive_foreground": "#787c99"
   }
   ```

3. Set the theme in your `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   theme: mytheme
   ```

4. Restart the application to use your custom theme.

See `example-theme.json` in the repository for a complete template with all available color properties. Colors can be specified as:
- Hex values: `#ff0000` or `#f00`
- ANSI 256 colors: `"1"`, `"33"`, `"196"`

### 2. Authentication

#### Personal Access Token (PAT) — default

On first run, the application will prompt you to enter your Azure DevOps PAT. The token is securely stored in your system's credential manager:
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service (gnome-keyring, KWallet, etc.)

You can also set the `AZDO_PAT` environment variable as a fallback if your system doesn't support a keyring. To update your PAT at any time, run `azdo auth`.

**Required PAT Scopes:**
| Scope | Access | Used For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Build** | Read | Pipeline runs, build timelines, and logs |
| **Code** | Read & Write | List PRs, view threads/iterations/diffs, vote on PRs, add comments, and update thread status |
| **Work Items** | Read & Write | Query and view work items, fetch available states, and change work item state |

To create a PAT:
1. Go to Azure DevOps → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Click "New Token"
3. Select the required scopes
4. Copy the generated token

#### Azure CLI Authentication

As an alternative to a PAT, azdo can obtain tokens via the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli):

```bash
# Install the Azure CLI, then log in
az login
```

Set `auth_method: az-cli` in your `config.yaml`. No PAT is needed — tokens are fetched automatically and cached with proactive refresh.
